## üßµ Threading
- Each worker thread consumes one job at a time.
- `@queue.pop` blocks until a job is available.
- Clean shutdown with `break unless job`.

## üß© Key Features
- Simple `Queue` synchronization using Ruby‚Äôs `Queue` class.
- Artificial delay using `sleep(0.5)` to mimic I/O latency.
- SQLite DB ensures persisted logs for verification.
